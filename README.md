# **Skittter-Snacks**
Skitter Snacks is a game jam project about a jumping spider attempting to steal doritos from ants. Created for the online "2022 PIGSQUAD Summer Slow Jam", over 12 days, with a focus on "Stealth" gameplay mechanics.

## Game Mechanics
The core game loop behind Skitter Snacks involves the player spider jumping around the map and trying to avoid the ants spotting them, while stealing the doritos while ducking and weaving between the ant's patrol path. Several key game mechanics are required to enable this game loop to function:
- AI system that chases the player when they are within line of sight.
- Unique "Jump" ability of the Player Spider to allow them to remove themselves from line of sight of the enemy Ant AI.
- Phermones released from the doritos that enable the player to spot the Doritos on the map and steal them.
- Dynamic audio track that updates as the player is continuously spotted by enemy Ants, until they begin their chase.

Link to the project on itch.io (DON'T RECOMMEND playing the Web Build, as it is very laggy and breaks the game, I am Aculater58 in the credits): https://bunnyufo.itch.io/skitter-snacks, Link to the Gamejam Entry: https://itch.io/jam/ssjstealth/rate/1627291 Link to EXE download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14eaOc_5DD9jxakztT3VzHbz7hy25LKin?usp=share_link. 
The controls for the game are: Moving - WASD, Hold spacebar to jump (Line indicates where you jump to). 
You have to eat all 7 of the doritos to win the game, the ants will chase you if they can find you.
