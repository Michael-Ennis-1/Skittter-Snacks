# Skittter-Snacks
Skitter Snacks is a game jam project I developed alongside 4 other talented developers. Created for the online "2022 PIGSQUAD Summer Slow Jam", over 12 days, with a focus on "Stealth" gameplay mechanics. The aim of Skitter Snacks is to eat all 7 doritoes scattered across the map without being caught by the patrolling guard ants. If you get spotted by an ant, they will send out phermones to inform all other ants in the local area to swarm around your position, hunting for their prey. So make sure to avoid their patrol paths as much as possible.
