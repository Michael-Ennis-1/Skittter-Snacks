# **Skittter-Snacks**
Skitter Snacks is a game jam project about a jumping spider attempting to steal doritos from ants. Created for the online "2022 PIGSQUAD Summer Slow Jam", over 12 days, with a focus on "Stealth" gameplay mechanics. I worked alongside 4 other talented developers for this project, including another programmer.

## Game Mechanics
The core gameplay loop of Skitter Snacks involves the player spider ducking and weaving between the ant's patrol paths while attempting to steal the doritos spread around the map. The player spider has a unique ability; being able to jump across the map by holding space bar. This enables them to avoid the ant's gaze and run away when spotted. Several key game mechanics are required to enable this game loop to function:

- AI system that chases the player when they are within line of sight.
- Unique "Jump" ability of the Player Spider to allow them to remove themselves from line of sight of the enemy Ant AI.
- Phermones released from the doritos that enable the player to spot the Doritos on the map and steal them.
- Dynamic audio track that updates as the player is continuously spotted by enemy Ants, until they begin their chase.

## My Contributions
I primarily worked upon the AI system for Skitter Snacks, as well as UI implementation and several other gameplay mechanics.
